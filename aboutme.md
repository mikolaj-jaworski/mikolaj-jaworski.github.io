<center> <h3>Skills</h3> </center>
- **Programming**: The lang that I use the most and is my favourite is Python. Despite having relevant experiences with R and SAS, I consider them less universal comparing to others. Moreover, I am interested in getting better with Julia for heavy scientific computing and learning Scala for big data engineering. <br>
- **Analytics**: I have experience with machine learning for classification, regression and (less often) clustering tasks. I use packages like scikit-learn, lightgbm, keras, pytorch (fastai). I have been doing simulations modeling and optimisation using genetic algorithms too. To visualize the results of my analyses I use PowerBI. Lastly, writing SQL queries is not an issue for me. <br>
- **Cloud Engineering**: Currently Azure ecosystem is part of my daily work. Main services are: DataFactory, Functions, MachineLearning, Databricks. Also I am familiar with Google Cloud services, but so far it is only course-based knowledge. My goal is to become proficient in data engineering and MLOps in the Cloud.

I changed insurance industry (Accenture and EY) to **LOT Polish Airlines**, where I work as Data Scientist & Engineer. I was always looking for working on something *touchable*, which would give me the opportunity to use my technical and analytical skills and see the real outcome. In the **Operations Research & Analytics team** we are tackling various tasks in the company, which converge to improvement of performance (punctuality and regularity) of the entire entity, which makes this goal very complex. It can be split into many sub-problems in many sectors of company's activities or phases from planning through execution to evaluation. <br>
Among many others, the list of my latest projects include:
- Predicting flight delays caused by weather, which would be the part of the ensemble, but may be used as separate service.
- Predicting number of passenger complaints per flight and eventually scoring passenger's propensity to complain.
- Fleet network performance simulation optimizing aircraft routing in order to minimize cumulative delay (or other specified target) by spotting bottlenecks and modify schedule if necessary.

I graduated from Warsach School of Economics with **Master's degree in Advanced Analytics**. For thesis, I decided to research medical image classification and convolutional neural networks. You can check the results [here](https://github.com/mikolaj-jaworski/histopathologic_cancer_detection). Also I was doing **second Master's degree in Quantitative Methods & Information Systems**, but my second thesis involving simulation modeling in evaluating airline schedules still remains undefended.
