    <tr>
        <td><b>Programming</b></td>
        <td>The lang that I use the most and is my favourite is Python. Despite having relevant experiences with R and SAS, I consider them less universal comparing to others. Moreover, I am interested in getting better with Julia for heavy scientific computing and learning Scala for big data engineering.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Analytics</b></td>
        <td>I have experience with machine learning for classification, regression and (less often) clustering tasks. I use packages like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, lightgbm, keras, pytorch (fastai). I have been doing simulations modeling and optimisation using genetic algorithms too. To visualize the results of my analyses I use PowerBI. Lastly, writing SQL queries is my bread and butter.</td>

        <td><b>Cloud Services</b></td>
        <td>Currently Google Cloud ecosystem is part of my daily work. The main sevices I use are: AI Platform, Colab Notebooks, BigQuery, DataFlow, Kubeflow. I have also wide experience with Azure: Data Factory, Functions, Machine Learning.</td>

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I was always looking for working on something <i>touchable</i>, which would give me the opportunity to use and extend my technical and analytical skills to see the real outcome.<br><br>

<img src="/assets/img/FLYR_Logo_Color.png" class="center" width="100" height="75"><br>
Currently I work at <a href="https://www.flyrlabs.com">FLYR Labs</a>, where I am part of the <b>Data Science Implementation</b> unit. We are focusing on airlines' revenue optimization using deep learning methods. In general, I am responsible for:
<ul>
    <li>Tailoring the solution for the client through proper training, validating and testing the models.</li>
    <li>Making sure that all the data pipelines are working correctly and the data itself has high quality.</li>
    <li>Working directly with the clients, addressing all the questions and concerns and fixing the issues.</li>
    <li>Taking active part in improving and develping our products.</li>
</ul>

<img src="/assets/img/LOT_logo.png" class="center" width="80" height="80"><br>
I moved to FLYR from <b>LOT Polish Airlines</b>, where I have been working in the <b>Operations Research & Analytics</b> team. We were tackling various tasks in the company and our goal was to improve performance (punctuality and regularity) of the entire entity. It could be split into many sub-problems in many sectors of company's activities or phases from flight planning through execution to evaluation.
Among many others, the list of my latest projects include:
<ul>
    <li>Predicting flight delays caused by weather, which would be the part of the ensemble, but may be used as separate service.</li>
    <li>Predicting number of passenger complaints per flight and eventually scoring passenger's propensity to complain.</li>
    <li>Fleet network performance simulation optimizing aircraft routing in order to minimize cumulative delay (or other specified target) by spotting bottlenecks and modify schedule if necessary.</li>
    <li>Optimizing on-board product stock by estimating clients demand.</li>
    <li>Mapping actual path of the airplane in the airspace for ATM cost verification.</li>
</ul>

Beforehand, I spent one year in insurance sector, initially as an <b>Intern at Accenture</b> and later as a <b>Data Analyst at EY</b>. I can highlight two projects from that time:
<ul>
    <li>Transfering capital reserve requirements calculation model (which was completely deterministic) from Excel spreadsheets to R Shiny app, which improved both usability (thanks to UI) and performance.</li>
    <li>Prototyping claim exortion detection model (based on ighly unbalanced data), with a goal of replacing previous conservative model.</li>
</ul>

<center> <h2>Education</h2> </center>
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
<img src="/assets/img/sgh_logo.png" class="center" width="80" height="80">
I graduated from <a href="https://ssl-www.sgh.waw.pl/en/Pages/default.aspx">Warsaw School of Economics</a> with <b>Master's degree in Advanced Analytics</b>. For thesis, I decided to research medical image classification and convolutional neural networks. You can check the results <a href="https://github.com/mikolaj-jaworski/histopathologic_cancer_detection">here</a>. Also I was doing <b>second Master's degree in Quantitative Methods & Information Systems</b>, but my second thesis involving simulation modeling in evaluating airline schedules still remains undefended.</div>
