<center> <h3>Skills</h3> </center>
- **Programming**: The lang that I use the most and is my favourite is Python. Despite having relevant experiences with R and SAS, I consider them less universal comparing to others. Moreover, I am interested in getting better with Julia for heavy scientific computing and learning Scala for big data engineering. <br>
- **Analytics**: I have experience with machine learning for classification, regression and (less often) clustering tasks. I use packages like scikit-learn, lightgbm, keras, pytorch (fastai). I have been doing simulations modeling and optimisation using genetic algorithms too. To visualize the results of my analyses I use PowerBI. Lastly, writing SQL queries is not an issue for me. <br>
- **Cloud Engineering**: Currently Azure ecosystem is part of my daily work. Main services are: DataFactory, Functions, MachineLearning, Databricks. Also I am familiar with Google Cloud services, but so far it is only course-based knowledge. My goal is to become proficient in data engineering and MLOps in the Cloud.

Currently I work at **LOT Polish Airlines** in Operations Reasearch & Analytics team, but our tasks are coming from every part of the company. We are automating processes, creating visualization dashboards and reports, designing ETL pipelines, building prediction systems. To be more specific, some of projects that I work on are:
- Complaint prediction, which is a combination of classification and regression problem, with a goal of estimating number of requests for compensation when the flight was somehow disturbed.
- Weather delay prediction, which is based mainly on METAR and TAF reports. This is a part of multiple models for predicting delays in general.
- Network simulation, where we have to test the stability (sometimes even executability) of the fleet schedule and spot the bottlenecks, if any exist.
